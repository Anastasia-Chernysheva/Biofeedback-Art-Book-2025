Note:Quite an extraordinary mobile opera event for 24 limousines took place in Los Angeles in the fall of 2015 called Hopscotch. See: http://hopscotchopera.com I was commissioned to write several scenes for this collective, collaborative project. One of the scenes, called The Experiment, involved audience members wearing mobile brainwave monitors. A singer sang questions to the audience and their collective brain activity directed a mix of sung and synthesized musical answers that would play in response. All this took place inside one of 24 moving limousines. These two pictures were staged to show the use of the brainwave monitoring headbands on a performer and audience member inside the car.DR
