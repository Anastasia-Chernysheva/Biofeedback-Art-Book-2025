BIOFEEDBACK ART-RESEARCH-PRACTICE NETWORK

About

We're a community of artists, scientists, and researchers exploring the intersection of biological data and artistic expression. Our goal is to integrate cutting-edge biofeedback technology in artistic practices to push the boundaries of conventional art-making and to challenge traditional notions of the relationship between mind and body. The biofeedback art research practice network is an interdisciplinary community dedicated to advancing our understanding of the human experience and providing new insights into the potential of art as a tool for self-expression and self-discovery.
